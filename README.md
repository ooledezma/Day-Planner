### Description

A very simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for standard buisness hours of the day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green). The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

### How to Use

- The user can click into any a timeblock and enter an event.
- The user must click the save button for that timeblock so the event could be saved even if the page gets refreshed.
